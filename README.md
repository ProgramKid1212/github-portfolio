## Final Year University Project
I participated in a university assignment where I worked with a team to design a mobile application that fitted the needs of a local business that we collaborated with. My final mark for this project was 92%.

### Profile Page
###### The app had a profile creation and sign in process that allowed users to store their data in the Firebase backend.

### Home Page – Calendar
###### This page would display the next planned date for events of the clubs you have signed up for.

### Home Page – Clubs
###### This page would allow the user to view different clubs and inspect their details. Each club is an item that can be dynamically added to a lazy scrolling list.

### Firebase Backend
###### I used a Firebase Realtime Database to record user data and include details about upcoming events. Any data changed in the database would update in realtime on the users end.

## First Full Unreal Project

My first project made in collaboration with Toxyn Games. This was made for the 2024 itch.io Pixel Jam. My two team members and I worked for 10 days to complete this for the deadline. It's an arcade style fishing where you try to catch the mythical Bloop.
